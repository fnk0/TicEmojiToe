Welcome to Tic Emoji Toe codelab! In this codelab you will create your very own
Tic Tac Toe game using Emoji's! The project has 12 emoji's available to be used
but feel free to change to other emoji's or images that make you happy! It's your game after all!

The 1st thing you need to do is [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and install it!

After Android studio is installed walk through the different steps of this codelab to create the app!

#### [Step 1: Creating the Project!](https://github.com/fnk0/TicEmojiToe/blob/master/step1.md)
#### [Step 2: Defining the XML Layout](https://github.com/fnk0/TicEmojiToe/blob/master/step2.md)
#### [Step 3: Styling the app!](https://github.com/fnk0/TicEmojiToe/blob/master/step3.md)
#### [Step 4: Connecting everything together!](https://github.com/fnk0/TicEmojiToe/blob/master/step4.md)
#### [Step 5: Finishing up the Details!](https://github.com/fnk0/TicEmojiToe/blob/master/step5.md)
#### Where to go from now?

Now that you know the basics try exploring Android by adding the following things to your app:

* Add a simple AI to allow you to play vs a computer: [AI Reference](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax)
* Allow players to choose their own name and Emoji.
* Add a leaderboard for Different Player Names
* Use Firebase to make the game online Multi Player
* Allow users to customize colors and options
 
Or... build another app! Try building an app for the community, your friends, dorm, etc.
