# Creating the Project

#### 1. After android studio has been installed launch it and you should see something similar to this:

#### 2. Next click on "Start a new Android Studio Project"

Give the project a name and select the Folder where to save it.

Note: the company domain will be the start of the package name of your app. I suggest you choose something like lastName.com
Note2: If you have a fairly common last name use something else, but it's very very rare that an app will have the same domain + app name

#### 3. Choose a Minimum SDK.

Note: the minimum SDK is the minimum required version of Android that your app will need to run.
If you are undecided click on the link "help me choose" to get some explanation. 

#### 4. Choose the Activity to add to your app

There's many options here, but we will choose the Empty activity for simplicity since we don't need any of the 
other features from the default ones
 
#### 5. Finish up the 1st activity creation
 
You can leave all the defaults. They are enough for what we need. Hit Finish and wait the project to be created.

After the project has been created we have something liks this now:

Now that we have our project created head up to Step 2 to start making the layout of the app.
